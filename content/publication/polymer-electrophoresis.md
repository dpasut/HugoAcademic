abstract = "Electrophoresis is widely used to sort DNA and polymers by size and is thus a much studied process. The majority of previous work has focused on using an electric field to drive polymers through a system containing obstacles that disturb their path. The goal of this research project is to investigate the outcome if these ’obstacles’ are no longer solid, but instead are constructed out of viscous inclusions. Using ESPResSo, a molecular dynamics package used for many-particle simulation, as well as Visual Molecular Dynamics to display simulations in real time, a sparse limit and a high density distribution of obstacles were examined with various viscosities between the posts and the surrounding fluid. The results are compared to the solid obstacle case. In the high post density distribution, as the viscosity of the posts increases, the mobility (velocity per unit force) of the polymer traveling through the system decreases below the mobility of the solid obstacle posts. For the sparse limit of obstacles, the high viscosity case now approaches the obstacle limit. This indicates that as the polymer travels through the system with viscous inclusions, it experiences different physics than the solid obstacle, which experiences wrapping and unwrapping dynamics. This leads to the belief that the geometry of the system influences the mobility of the polymer. This work suggests the possibility of using viscous inclusions in the sorting of DNA and polymers."
